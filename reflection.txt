Reflections 

In today's class, we learned what is AI. I learned that there are two dimensions to define Artificial Intelligence, thinking and behaviors, and humanly and rationally.
Then we discussed the properties of a rational agent - preforms actions to achieve a given goal in an environment based on what it perceieves in 
an optimal manner. We also looked at the history of the relatively new field of Artificial Intelligence, from the birth of Connectionism and Good Old Fashioned AI,
to the AI winter because researchers were stuck to using logical reasoning to develop AI. One thing that I found fascinating was how quickly the AI was able to outsmart
humans in playing games.
